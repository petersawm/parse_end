This project is built for [Brief description of what the project does].

## Directory Structure

init_scripts/
server/
workers/
.gitignore
docker-compose.yml
requirements.txt
start.bat

* **`init_scripts/`**: Contains initial scripts required to set up the project. This might include scripts for setting up environment variables, creating necessary directories, etc.
* **`server/`**: Houses the server-side code of the project. This directory likely contains API endpoints and business logic.
* **`workers/`**: Contains code for background tasks, such as queue processing or scheduled jobs.
* **.gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This typically includes files like `.env`, log files, etc.
* **`docker-compose.yml`**: A YAML file used to define and manage Docker containers for the project's services, such as the server and workers.
* **`requirements.txt`**: If the project is built with Python, this file lists the external Python packages and their versions required by the project. These can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **`start.bat`**: A batch script for Windows systems to start the project. This script likely contains the commands needed to run the server and workers.

## Getting Started
